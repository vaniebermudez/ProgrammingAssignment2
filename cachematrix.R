## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
## Assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set, 
             get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        matr <- x$get()
        m <- solve(matr, ...)
        x$setInverse(inv)
        inv
}
